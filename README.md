# MikesGradingTool

This a Python console app.  It's purpose is to help me (Mike) do offline grading when working with the Canvas LMS.

It's based on an earlier version of this software which had a lot more features.  I trimmed this down to just the stuff that I'm actually, currently using.  Plus, it'll make it easier to create a Wheel file for use with pipx locally and/or eventually publishing to PyPI.
